        Make sure you have created a git branch before running below command and make sure the existance of file:

            .pre-commit-config.yaml

        pre-commit run --all-files

    export FLASK_APP=flaskpine.py

To test:

    flask test

    flask test --coverage


** Database migration

    Make sure that:

    export FLASK_APP=flaskpine.py

    First run this to create migration directory:

    flask db init

    $ flask db migrate

    $ flask db upgrade

    That is not what you want.

    flask load_data > db_backup/logs/log.file 2>&1

    flask test > db_backup/logs/log.file 2>&1
